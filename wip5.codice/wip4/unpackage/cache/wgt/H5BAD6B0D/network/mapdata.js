Bolsonaro's policy is annihilating Brazil's ability to combat deforestation, favoring those who commit environmental crimes and encouraging violence against indigenous peoples and traditional forest communities.Protecting the Amazon and all the forests of the planet must be everyone's goal: certainly the Brazilian government, but also all other countries, including the European Union, which must adopt legislation capable of guaranteeing that the the food we eat and the products placed on the market were not obtained by sacrificing human rights and forests.",

Despite its large resources, the country benefits very little from this international trade in raw materials. Working conditions in the mine are very bad. Accidents and white deaths are frequent, especially in the regions of Katanga, where the mines built and managed in an artisanal way are numerous. Working hours often exceed 12 hours per day. About 40,000 children aged 3 to 7 work daily in the mines; other hundreds of thousands of workers operate in precarious conditions that challenge the most elementary rules on job safety.",

In 2002 it exceeded the expected capacity: it should have been closed instead it has continued to grow by 10 meters every year, with hundreds of trucks unloading 2000 tons of garbage every day. The hill has already reached 65 meters in height. A recent study has shown that the nauseating fumes and toxic gases produced cause serious damage to the health of those who live in the surrounding area making the effects felt up to 5 km away. Furthermore, the methane produced by the decomposition of waste often ignites spontaneously and it takes days to put out fires and the liquid that drips from the garbage ends up in an open canal that runs through the neighborhood. Indian megacities are among the largest waste producers in the world, with about 62 million tons per year: according to recent projections by a government agency, in 2030 Indian waste could reach 165 million tons.",
